# IPL Match Predictor & Analytics Engine (2008-2024) 🏏

## 📌 Project Overview
This project goes beyond standard analytics to build a **Predictive Model** for IPL cricket matches. Using 16 years of ball-by-ball data, I developed a Machine Learning solution to quantify the impact of the Powerplay on final team totals.

## 🚀 Key Insight: The "Powerplay Multiplier"
* **The Discovery:** My Linear Regression model discovered a **1.46x Multiplier**.
* **What it means:** For every **1 run** scored in the Powerplay (Overs 0-6), the final team score tends to increase by **~1.5 runs**.
* **Strategic Value:** This quantifies the "cost" of a slow start—scoring 10 extra runs in the first 6 overs is statistically worth 15 runs in the final total.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Python (Scikit-Learn):** Used for training the Linear Regression model (`Slope = 1.46`).
* **Python (Pandas):** For cleaning 200,000+ rows of ball-by-ball data.
* **Power BI:** Created an interactive dashboard with "Actual vs. Predicted" scatter plots and trend lines.

## 📂 Files Included
* `IPL_Analysis.ipynb` - The full Python code (Data Cleaning + Machine Learning).
* `IPL_Dashboard_project.pbix` - The Power BI file with the predictive analytics view.
* `IPL_Predictions.csv` - The raw output data generated by the model.
